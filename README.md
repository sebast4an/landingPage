## Use:
* HTML5 semantics

* CSS Grid & Flexbox
* Media queries
* [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
* Google fonts

## Currently:
This project has one big problem in my opinion: fontello fonts. **I am ashamed of this because I should use SVG**. In the future when I have free time - I will change this :)
